A bot is a player controlled by the computer. By default, when there are not enough players for a specific map, the places are filled in with bots, and once a new player joins the game, one of the bots gets removed from the game. The bots are controlled by players' computers, and players may order the bots by typing the name of the bot in chat, followed by a command. If only the bot name is entered, it will list available orders.
