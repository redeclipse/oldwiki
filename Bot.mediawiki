A bot is a player controlled by the computer. In online games, the CPU load of bots is distributed over clients.

==Icon==

Bots are easily recognized by the icon right next to their name.

==Orders==
Players can give orders to all bots in their team, or to a specific bot. 

This can be done with a chat command consisting of two or three keywords.
* First word: A bot's name, or just '''bots''' to address all
* Second word: An order
** attack - chase a flag or ball
** defend - assist the player or defend a place
** forget - go back to the previous order
** reset - ignore all previous orders
* Third word: A target - depends on the order and game mode.

Bots will reply by either confirming the order or with some hints. If an order is incomplete, the bot will reply with available options to complete the order.

==Balancing==
By default, when there are not enough players for a specific [[Game::maps|map]], the places are filled in with bots, and once a new player joins the game, one of the bots gets removed from the game. When playing offline or as a (local) operator, the amount of bots can be controlled via certain variables:
* botoffset - add or subtract a number of bots per team
* botbalance - allows to disables bots or specify a limit per team
* botlimit - the maximum number of bots in total

==Skill and behavior==
The range of random bot skill levels can be tuned with two variables:
* botskillmin
* botskillmax
A skill value of 101 means that the bot reacts with full speed and precision. However, that does not necessarily mean that bots are intelligent, especially in team games with complex objectives. Other ways to make bots considerably tougher or weaker in combat are to alter their overall speed, maximum health or scale (model size).

Furthermore, bots can be prevented from using their attacks.
* aipassive 1 - never attack human players
* aipassive 2 - do not attack anybody

'''Note:''' There are separate bot variables for some game mutators or modes, such as the [[mutator_Tips#coop|coop]] mutator.
