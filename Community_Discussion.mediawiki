== About this page ==
Previously [http://redeclipse.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=278 this] forum topic was used to collaborate, but my hope is to self-contain the happenings of the wiki from the forums, so we can talk more about the wiki and not spam the forums, in the cause to make a worthy wiki to help new players in-game and it's functions (and so their experience, leading to the the games overall exposure). What do you guys think about this? --[[User:Honno|Honno]] ([[User talk:Honno|talk]]) 09:13, 5 February 2015 (EST)
