== Connect to an Online Server ==

* You can connect to online servers using the server list
or
* Open the console (~ / t or enter key) and type
 /connect ''ipnumber''
Replacing ''ipnumber'' with the IP of the server

=== Join Password ===

If the server you are trying to connect to has a join password set, you will need to either
* Right-click on the server entry in the list and set the password
or
* Connect using
 /connect ''ipnumber'' ''0'' ''password''
Replacing ''password'' with the correct password (setting ''0'' uses the default port number).

or
* Open the console (~ / t or enter key) and connect directly
 /connect 192.168.1.###
