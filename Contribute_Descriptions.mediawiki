== Instructions for contributing ==

This page contains a copy of the file data/usage.cfg from the Red Eclipse source, it is intended as a place to contribute descriptions for variables and commands, such that they may be added to the Red Eclipse on-screen help and to the auto-generated wiki pages.

* Check here and at http://svn.icculus.org/*checkout*/redeclipse/data/config/usage.cfg that you are not adding a duplicate
* Please follow the format exactly
* Please use a good clarification for parameters (e.g. <clientnum>) where appropriate
** Please use <value> as a generic description otherwise
* Entries can be added either besides similar entries, or towards the end (but before the weapon vars loop)
** Weapon vars should be added within the substitution loops
