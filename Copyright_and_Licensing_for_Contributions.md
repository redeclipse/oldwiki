### Important

<font size= 4>Please note that this information only reflects the opinions and guesses of me Martin "arand" Werner.

This information is not written by a lawyer and is not legal advice.&lt;/font size&gt;

### Terminology

-   "Data" here refers to game assets, for example maps, music, textures, etc.
-   As a general rule Red Eclipse itself uses the CC-BY-SA-3.0+ license for data and the Zlib license for code

-   Pick an "open-source friendly" license **without** non-commercial restrictions for the work
    -   Don't use GPL licenses unless it has a "font-exception" clause or similar
    -   Don't use public-domain unless it's **explicitly** CC-0

You are **encouraged** to:

-   Keep your individual copyright for the work
-   Use CC-BY-SA-3.0+ or CC-BY-3.0+ as the license (or something else if you have a personal preference)

## If you contribute code to Red Eclipse

### Small changes to the code (for example patches)

-   Your copyright for the code will be **assigned** to Quinton "quin" Reeves and Lee "eihrul" Salzman

### Large changes to the code

You are **required** to:

-   Use the Zlib license (or a compatible license) for the code

If you want to:

-   You may **assign** your copyright for the code to Quinton "quin" Reeves and Lee "eihrul" Salzman

## Notes

1.  The GPL and the CC-BY-SA-3.0 are incompatible licenses, that means that a combined work from data using both licenses (for example a screenshot) might be undistributable, we want to avoid this. If the GPL license has a "Font Exception" clause or similar, this should not be a problem.

2.  The CC licenses prior to 3.0 are unclear on some key points, and may not be very good licenses because of this, see for example [this summary](http://evan.prodromou.name/ccsummary/ccsummary.html) for more information, note that if your work is an Adaptation of a work based on versions prior to 3.0 you can upgrade the license to version 3.0 and it works out ok.

3.  Copyright assignment to the Red Eclipse team is the case for a lot of the contributions by the regular developers of Red Eclipse, which also are a part of the Red Eclipse Team, so the copyright is shared. The Red Eclipse Team is not a well defined group, other than Quinton "quin" Reeves and Lee "eihrul" Salzman being the Team Lead.

4.  The plus (+) here meaning version 3.0 or later.

5.  For MIT (Expat), Zlib, CC-BY-3.0, and CC-BY-SA-3.0 this is normally fairly straightforward; the resulting license for a combined work will be the rightmost one in that order (i.e. the most restrictive). For anything more advanced, do some reading and/or ask around.

6.  Public Domain is not a license, modern use of "Public Domain" is often considered unclear, depending on whom you ask. See <http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Public_domain> for more information. [CC-0](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ) (or similar all-permissive licenses) is normally the best way to do the conceptual equivalent of "Public Domain".
