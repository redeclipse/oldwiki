Cross compiling is the process of compiling code to run on a different platform than the platform running the compiler. For example, building a Windows runnable while running Linux is cross compiling. More on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler cross compilers] on Wikipedia.


== For Windows from GNU/Linux ==
* Install mingw-w64 or equivalent, on a Debian-like system, this can be done via
 sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
* Compile for x86 and amd64 using the commands
 make -C src/ PLATFORM=CROSSMINGW clean install
 make -C src/ PLATFORM=CROSSMINGW64 clean install

* Note: If on Ubuntu 12.04, the package g++-mingw-w64 may also be required.


== For GNU/Linux from Windows ==
* Don't. Just don't.
