CubeScript is the scripting language of the [http://cubeengine.com/ Cube 2 engine]. Such scripts can be entered via the [[console]] or executed via files in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content directory]]. This allows to customize many aspects of the game client without the need to compile any sources.

==Applications==

CubeScript can be used to
* customize any of the existing in-game [[menus]] or create new [[menus]] from scratch,
* design scripted events in a map using [[Entity_Linking#Scriptable_Events|trigger]] entities,
* or run any sequence of [[Vars_and_Commands_Tables|commands or variable settings]] that can be entered in the [[console]].

==Usage descriptions in the console==

In the regular chat (or team chat) prompt, a leading forward slash (/) allows to execute commands via the console. The same can be done via the tilde (~) or forward slash (/) keys (per default). The console supports tab-completion, which is useful to cycle through the available [[Vars_and_Commands_Tables|commands and variables]]. For many of these, usage instructions are shown as they are entered. This can be default values of a variable or explanations of a command's arguments. Note that most game variables can be set in the console by simply entering their name, followed by a new value as an argument, for example

  /playername frogger_afk

==Alias lookups and containers==

New aliases (variables) can be defined with the alias command or an assignment, which are equivalent as shown below

  alias pi 3.14159
  pi = 3.14159

The value of the alias can be looked up either via the $ (getalias) or the @ (macro) token. The below example is typical for commands that are evaluated to return a result value: The command (a sine function) is followed by one or several arguments (our alias lookup), and a bracket container is used to substitute the result (so it is printed via echo).

  /echo "hello world"
  /echo (cos $pi)
  /echo (cos @pi)

The differences between the $ and @ tokens are subtle, complicated to understand in detail, and likely to cause unexpected results. In the above example, the @pi lookup should actually be in square brackets - here it gives the seemingly correct result only by chance.

For basic scripting, though, the $ token should be perfectly sufficient and save to use, with one important exception: When writing [[menus]] that use buttons in a loop, the button actions (or any ''onchange'' arguments) should use the @ token for the control variable. (For a detailed explanation, the external tutorials linked below can be consulted.)

  newgui example [
      looplist i $weapname [
          guibutton $i [echo @i]
      ]
  ]
  showgui example

This example script also shows the use of square brackets to form a block of code that serves as one argument of a command. This is the only sane way to split a command on several lines, preferably with an indention of four spaces.

==Executing scripts==

Scripts are typically saved as '''cfg''' files in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content directory]]. For example, the script ''myvars.cfg'' can be executed using
   /exec myvars.cfg

Notes:

*If [[Vars_and_Commands_Tables|commands or variables]] are entered via the [[console]], each line usually begins with a slash (/). In script files, there are no such leading slashes.

*Scripts can be executed automatically using [[Game_Settings#autoexec.cfg|autoexec.cfg]].

==Special string formatting==

As a side note, there are some special tags to format strings with colours or icons, which can be fun to use, for instance in chat messages or in a /servermotd.

* ^n  - newline
* ^"  - a double quote sign
* ^t  - a (useless) tab
* ^f  - a format code as follows:
** ^f() - allows to insert a texture, for example "^f(textures/modes/race)hurry up!"
** ^f[] - use a hex code to colourize the text, for instance "^f["$zappercolour"]pzap!"
** ^fC  - use a predefined colour C

The single letter codes for predefined colours are:

'''r'''ed, '''g'''reen, '''b'''lue,
'''cyan''', '''m'''agenta, '''y'''ellow,
'''w'''hite, gr'''a'''y and blac'''k''',
'''v'''iolet, '''p'''ink and brow'''n''''.

Most of these colours are also available in a darker shade using a capital letter.

Furthermore, the letter z can be followed by two more colour tags to create flashing texts, for example 
  "^fzyoBoOoM!"
Flashing texts should be used with '''caution''', as they can be very annoying - excessive use can get you muted.

Finally, the ^fs tag can be used to store the current colour, and push it back with a ^fS tag.
  "^frRed^fs^fbBlue^fSRed"
