== Windows ==

* Download [http://redeclipse.net/download/windows the Windows installer].
* When it is done, double click the resulting EXE installer.
* Run through the prompts to install Red Eclipse on your computer.
* Run the <code>Red Eclipse</code> shortcut placed in your Start Menu.

== Linux ==
* Install Git and the run dependencies of Red Eclipse. On a Debian-like system (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint), this can be done with the command 
** <code>sudo apt-get install git curl libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl-image1.2</code>
* Download [http://redeclipse.net/download/linux the Linux tarball].
* When it is done, move the resulting TAR.BZ2 file to your home directory (~/ or $HOME = /home/username).
* Extract the contents into your home directory using your favourite archive utility.
** Terminal command: <code>tar -jxvf redeclipse_X.Y.Z_linux.tar.bz2</code>
* Enter the resulting folder (which will be called <code>~/redeclipse-X.Y.Z</code> where X.Y.Z is the version number of the package).
* Run <code>./redeclipse.sh</code>
* For auto updates you will need to install <code>git</code> and <code>curl</code> (something like: <code>sudo apt-get install git curl</code>).

== OS X ==

* Download [http://redeclipse.net/download/osx the OS X tarball].
* When it is done, click the resulting TAR.BZ2 file in your downloads folder on the dock.
* Archive utility will extract the contents into the same folder and open a Finder window with <code>redeclipse.app</code> highlighted.
* Drag and drop the <code>redeclipse.app</code> package to your favourite location (Desktop, Applications folder, whatever).
* Run <code>redeclipse.app</code>. If this is the first time running the app, the operating system complains that it can't run an unsigned package, simply right (or cmd) click and select <code>Open</code>. In future you will be able to run the app as normal, this will override the warning for all future attempts.
