=== Overview ===

Affluence is a medium-sized team map in an L shape. It is suitable for team games due to its relatively linear layout. Twin towers provide verticality, but beware the forbidden beaches below.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Affluence's large use of water and specularity makes it a relatively difficult map framerate-wise
* The rocket past the apex of the "L" over the top of the beach, making it a risky grab. It does ''not'' spawn in kaboom games.
* Unfortunately, you can't go down to the splendid beaches.
* Bomber-ball and Defend & Control have different explosive quantities and locations.
