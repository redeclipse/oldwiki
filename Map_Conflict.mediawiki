One of the newer additions to official RE provides a ton of vertical action on its four levels. Gameplay is smooth and fast-paced; a newfound favorite of many long-time players.

=== Notes & Strategies ===

* Use the jumping pads on the outer areas of the map to surprise those sniping above.
* The rocket spawns in the middle of the second level, where the walkways cross.
* Grenades are in abundance on this map; use them well.
