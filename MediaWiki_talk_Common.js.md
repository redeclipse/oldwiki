I don't get what the function you put here is good for, but the corresponding collection of scripts on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.js) provides some useful features, such as collapsible tables, which can be nice for navigation bar templates at the bottom of related pages.

  
Yeah, I'm still new to how MediaWiki works but pretty much skys the limit when you've got power over js and css. The script I put on is used for a horizontal list script I found and probably more. Actually was thinking of collapsible sections for an all-inclusive weapons page.--[Honno](User:Honno "wikilink") ([talk](User_talk:Honno "wikilink")) 11:16, 3 February 2015 (EST)
