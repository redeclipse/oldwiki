All menus or guis of Red Eclipse are written in [[CubeScript]] using a set of gui commands. This means the menus can be simply modified with a text editor, without the need to compile any source code. The existing menus are therefore conveniently customized - and they also provide a large set of examples for creating your own custom menus. Such menus could be used in a campaign-like map, or for example to execute administrative commands.

==Preface==
===Accessing the in-game menus===

The game-menus are found in a subdirectory of the Red Eclipse install directory:
  /config/menus/
The corresponding link to the development version on github is [https://github.com/red-eclipse/base/tree/master/config/menus here].

When customizing the in-game menus, it is highly recommended to leave the files unmodified in the install directory, and work on a copy in the [[Game_Settings#User_Content|user content directory]]. In this case, the in-game menus can be overriden by executing the modified script

  exec mymenu.cfg

===A minimalistic example===
The following script will define and display a menu with just a title and one text line.

  newgui hello [
      guitext "hello world"
  ]
  showgui hello

===A test alias===
If you are familiar with the use of aliases and [[CubeScript]], you can quickly test and preview gui commands via the [[console]]. For example, the following alias can be used:

  /testgui = [ newgui test [ @arg1 ] ; showgui test ]

To reproduce the minimalistic example above, this alias can be used as follows:
  /testgui [guitext "hello world"]

This may seem fairly complicated, but it can be convenient to read the [[CubeScript#Usage_descriptions_in_the_console|usage descriptions]] and quickly check how the commands work.

===Use of gui commands===

The following sections describe many of the available gui elements and commands, which are usually not covered in  external [[CubeScript]] tutorials. These commands typically have some optional arguments, which are shown in [brackets] and can be rather complicated to use.

If a command is entered in the [[console]], usage instructions are indicated in many cases. This also holds true for many gui commands, and roughly corresponds to the following descriptions.

The ordering of a command's arguments matters. This means that, for instance, if you want to specify the colour (third argument) of a guibutton, a texture (second argument) must be given as well:
  guitext "just a test line" "" 0xffff00 
In this case, the empty texture string "" simply means that no icon is shown next to the button.


==creation and display of menus==

===guiheader===

sets the header title of the menu, replacing the first argument of newgui in the title bar.

usage: guiheader ''value''

===guistayopen===

Usually, clicking a button or image to trigger an action will close the menu.

This rule does not apply to buttons or images in a guistayopen block.

usage: guistayopen ''content''

===guitab===

creates a new tab for the current menu. Note: The first tab of each menu is already impied by newgui.

usage: guitab ''name''

===guicount===

Returns the number of menus in the current gui stack.
==basic gui elements==

===guitext===

creates a text element;

*''text'' can be a raw string or a variable,

*[''icon''] is the path to an image, example: textures/bomb,

*[''colour''] is a hexadecimal colour code, example: 0xFF0000, 

*[''iconcolour''] acts on the ''icon'' just like ''colour'' acts on the ''text'',

*[''wrap''] specifies a width limit, which allows the text to expand over several lines

usage: guitext ''text'' [''icon''] [''colour''] [''iconcolour''] [''wrap'']

===guibutton===

creates a text button;

*''name'' refers to the button's variable name,

*''action'' defines what the button does,

*[''alt-act''] defines what the button does when right-clicked,

*[''icon''] is the path to an image, example: textures/bomb,

*[''colour''] is a hexadecimal colour code, example: 0xFF0000

usage: guibutton ''name'' ''action'' [''alt-act''] [''icon''] [''colour'']

===guiimage===

creates a clickable image;

*''path'' is the path to an image, example: textures/bomb,

*[''action''] defines what clicking the image does,

*[''scale''] defines the scale of the image,

*[''overlaid''] whether or not the image is overlaid with guioverlaytex (true/false),

*[''alt-path''] alternate image to use if ''path'' cannot be loaded,

*[''alt-act''] defines what the image does when right clicked,

*[''colour''] is a hexadecimal colour code - useful to colorize icons, e.g. for weapons or teams

usage: guiimage ''path'' [''action''] [''scale''] [''overlaid''] [''alt-path''] [''alt-act''] [''colour'']

===guicheckbox===

creates a checkbox;

*''name'' a text string shown to the right of the checkbox,

*''variable'' refers to the alias/var that the checkbox controls,

*[''on''] is the value given to ''variable'' when the checkbox is on, and vice-versa for [''off''], if these are not specified, 1/0 is assumed,

*[''onchange''] is the action taken whenever the checkbox is toggled,

*[''colour''] is a hexadecimal colour code, example: 0xFF0000

usage: guicheckbox ''name'' ''var'' [''on''] [''off''] [''onchange''] [''colour'']

===guiradio===

creates a radio button;

*''name'' a text string shown to the right of the radio button,

usage: guiradio ''name'' ''var'' ''value'' [''onchange''] [''colour'']
==gui layout elements==

===guilist===

adds ''content'' to a list. Guilists can be nested to arrange gui elements horizontally and vertically.

This also allows to structure the layout in order to use guibars, guisliders and coloured guibackgrounds.

usage: guilist ''content''

===guibody===

allows a list of gui elements to act like a single button;

*''content'' is a block of code inside an implied guilist,

*''action'' is the action taken when clicking any element of ''content''

*[''onhover''] is executed when the mouse moves over the boundary of the guibody - useful for guitooltip

usage: guibody ''content'' ''action'' [''alt-act''] [''onhover'']

===guispring===

adds weight to a menu for pushing elements more/less to one side;

example: guilist [ guispring ; guitext centered; guispring ]

usage: guispring [''value'']

===guistrut===

adds spacing to a menu;

if [''bool''] is 1, it wraps the guistrut in a guilist (adds spacing in the alternate direction),

guistrut 5 1 is the same as guilist [ guistrut 5 ]

usage: guistrut ''amount'' [''bool'']

===guibar===

draws either a vertical or a horizontal line, depending on the nesting of guilist

===guifont===

*[''bordercolour''] is the colour of the border,

*[''borderblend''] is the opacity of the border,

*[''border''] determines if the border is drawn (0 or 1),

usage: guibackground ''colour'' [''blend''] [''bordercolour''] [''borderblend''] [''border''] [''levels'']

===guifill===

creates a coloured background for the current guilist, but without the skin settings of guibackground.

This implies sharp corners, no borders and a blend value of 0.5;

*''colour'' is in hexadecimal, example: 0xFF0000,

*[''levels''] specifies how many guilist levels to go back

usage: guifill ''colour'' [''levels'']
