The statistics system, introduced after 1.5.3, records results of games and sends them to a central database on the master server.

==To Enable in servinit.cfg==
<source lang=text>
sv_serverstats 1 //Your server must have the s flag in its auth for this to take effect.
</source>

==Sending Process==
*Before the server will send statistics, '''sv_serverstats''' must be 1 and the server must have the '''s''' (statistics) flag on its authentication handle.
*To be sent to the master server, a game needs to meet at least one of the following requirements:
**Entered intermission.
**Be timed race and have at least one finished lap. (So race records are kept even for unfinished games)
*The server will then send the game statistics to the master server.
*The master server will save the game statistics to its sqlite database and return the game ID for the server to display.

==Web Interface==
The statistics web interface/API is at http://redeclipse.net/stats<br>
It runs alongside the master server and reads from the sqlite database to return sorted data about games, maps, players, modes, and weapons.<br>

==Privacy==
The only information collected by the system about a player's identity is their nickname and their authentication handle.<br>
IP addresses are not collected, and tracking can only be done via auth handle. Unauthenticated users will only appear in game pages, they will not have a player page.
