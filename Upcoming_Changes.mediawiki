With Red Eclipse 1.6.0 looming on the horizon, a lot of changes are being made.

This page will be frequently edited to reflect the current ideology of the developers.


== Maps marked for removal ==

With Red Eclipse 1.6.0, we decided a map cleaning had to take place.

As Molexted likes to refer to it, the "dumpster fire of maps" will be cleaned up.

Maps that do not fit these criteria will be removed / rejected:


* Does not fit the general style, lore or direction of the game.

* The map layout does not flow well or is too simple / too open for the current game physics.

* The quality of the map is poor (poor details, repetitive textures, rampant bugs) and no remake is in the pipeline.

* The general concensus points to people not liking the map


The faith of most parkour map is undecided, and thus, they have not been included here.
Some of the maps in this list have been reworked and have been marked as such.
Otherwise, you can find the reason for its removal next to it.
